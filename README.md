# Inverse_Permutation
This project provides a solution to Inverse_Permutation algorith



Given an array A of size n of integers in the range from 1 to n, we need to 
find the inverse permutation of that array.
Inverse Permutation is a permutation which you will get by inserting position 
of an element at the position specified by the element value in the array. For 
better understanding, consider the following example:
Suppose we found element 4 at position 3 in an array, then in reverse 
permutation, we insert 3 (position of element 4 in the array) in position 4 
(element value)


Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2}
Output:
1 4 3 2
Explanation:
For element 1 we insert position of 1 from
arr1 i.e 1 at position 1 in arr2. For element
4 in arr1, we insert 2 from arr1 at position
4 in arr2. Similarly, for element 2 in arr1,
we insert position of 2 i.e 4 in arr2
